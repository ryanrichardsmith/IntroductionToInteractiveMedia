# My Experience
- The idea behind my assignment was a program that randomly generates a playlist based on a given emotion, or as I refer to it, "vibe." Thus, I found songs from 10 of my favorite artists that matched each of the seven vibes I wanted to include: chill, sad, dance party, confidence boost, karaoke, throwback and happy. These songs were entered in a csv file (located in this folder) where each row corresponded to an artist, and the index of each row corresponded to a specific vibe
- Thus, the program would randomly generate an integer that would correspond to a particular index of each row which, in turn, would correspond to a specific music vibe, producing a curated playlist for a given feeling.
