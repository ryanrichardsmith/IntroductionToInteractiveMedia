# My Process
- Upon looking at the photos meant to inspre us, I immediately thought there was no way I would be able to make something that abstract and, as Casey Reas would put it, chaotic. I briefly considered doing music notes on sheet music that would get increasingly disorganized to represent "dissonance." However, I was finally inspired to do a randomized deconstruction of the classic fruit bowl paintings many of us haveen seen before:

- Although I knew I wanted the fruits to be strewn all over the canvas in no order, which would require a loop to avoid repeatedly coding them, but I decided to use the random() function to make things more interesting. As a result, the decision of which fruit to place in each designated position was left to this function.
