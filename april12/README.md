## Description
We created an instrument partly inspired by the smooth sound of a rock guitar solo and the intense beat of bass drums. When the push button is held, the popsicle sticks hit the box one after another similar to drumsticks hitting a drum, otherwise the sticks are stationary. When light from a phone is shined directly on the light sensor, the system produces a note whose frequency changes according to the intensity of the light it receives. Even cooler, when the push button is being held, the note produced only changes after every two hits from the sticks, leading to distinct changes in the tone and somewhat of a melody when paired with the movement of the sticks, as shown in the video.

## Development Process Overview
First, we began working on the analog sensing portion of the instrument. After building a simple circuit with the photoresistor, we observed that the normal lighting in the IM Lab resulted in a certain reading (~ 530), and we made that reading our base value, meaning that any light sensed above it should result in the notes being played. Programming this was simple using an if-then-else statement like the one we learned in class, and we also made the brightness of the light correlate to the pitch of the note by using the value of `sensorValue` as the frequency argument for the `tone()` function. 

Next, we began working on the digital sensing aspect firstly by attaching popsicle sticks to the servo motor attachment used in class and attaching the servo motor to the box in order to give it a fixed stance. We first experimented with just one servo motor to determine which angles would work best for the two positions of the sticks (essentially touching the box/not touching the box). We used the servo motor example from class for this, and once we were satisfied with the movement of one of the sticks, we set up the other one and incorporated it into the circuit. The last step was to combine these two test programs by editing them so that they worked smoothly together.
