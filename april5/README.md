## Description
For my first program, I aimed to use the push button as my digital input. I wanted to create a pulsating effect along four LEDs, having each subsequent LED fade to brightness while the previous one faded to darkness. The catch was that this effect only happens when the user is pressing the button; otherwise, the lights should be off.

## Problems
- At first, I could not figure out how to make the LEDs fade in a sequential way, but I found a YouTube video that helped me to realize it was only a matter of breaking up the fade example we learned in class for each LED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-apGA_8SmxY
- Also, ss evidenced by the video, I was unable to figure out how to make the lights pulse only when the user pushes the button, and as a result they do the effect indepdendent of the button.
