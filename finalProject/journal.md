### Preliminary Concept
For my final project I will be working alone. I hope to create a videogame not unlike the [dinosaur game](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LxwDo3KSoeg) that Google Chroome uses to entertain us when the WiFi stops working. Essentially, I would like to have some avatar that will either be in a neutral position (standing) or jumping/ducking from oncoming obstacles according to what the user does. The visual gamescape will be created in p5, and the plan is to have two push buttons hooked up to my Arduino, let's say a red and a blue, and when the user pushes the blue button, the avatar should duck, whereas when they push the red button, the avatar should jump, and both should only occur as long as the user is pushing or holding the button. If neither of the buttons is being pushed, the avatar should be in a neutral position. Once the avatar touches an obstacle, the game is over and the user will be able to play again (hopefully by clicking some key on their keyboard). 

## Finalized Project
I will be working with Aisha, and a detailed explanation of our project is in [her journal](https://github.com/aisahodzic/IntroToIM/blob/main/finalProject/journal.md).
