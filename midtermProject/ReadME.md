## Concept 
My game is centered around games that require the player to select the odd one out of a group of similar items. In this case, the items are fish and the odd one out is differentiated by having a slightly darker color from the rest. If the player clicks on the "normal" fish, they lose the game, and if they click the correct fish they earn a point. The inspiration and early concept for my game can be found in my journal.

## My Experience
Throughout this project I went through multiple idea changes mostly caused by the technological limitations of what I knew about p5js; that is, while it was easy for me to conceptualize some ideas (like a timer), it was difficult for me to implement those ideas in my code. This project also showed me the value of collaboration. By having my friends look over my code to help me figure out what my bugs were, I was grateful that they could pinpoint exactly where the logic had errors, and even though they couldn't help me to fix the bugs in the end, it was more productive than if I had spent hours staring at the screen. Along that same vein, having my friends try out my program helped me to both confirm the limitations of my game that I was already aware of and bring some new ones to light. A more detailed breakdown of my process can be also found in my jouurnal.
